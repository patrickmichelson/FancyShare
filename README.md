# FancyShare

A tool to share parts of a screen in online meeting apps.

It requires [Microsoft PowerToys FancyZone](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FancyZones) to configure layouts which split the screen into multiple zones.

FancyShare enables sharing of a single zone by creating a transparent overlay window on top of a zone. This window can be selected as the application to share by apps supporting single window sharing.
